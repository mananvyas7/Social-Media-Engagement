# Social Media Engagement
 ---  # Social Media Engagement Analytics Module  This project demonstrates a basic analytics module for simulating and analyzing engagement metrics on social media posts. The system uses tools like **DataStax Astra DB** for database operations, **Langflow** for workflow automation, and **GPT** for generating insights.  ## Project Overview  The purpose of this module is to simulate, store, analyze, and generate insights on engagement metrics for different types of social media posts (e.g., reels, carousels, static images). It includes the following steps:  1. **Simulating Engagement Data**:      Created a mock dataset representing likes, shares, and comments for various post types.  2. **Storing Data in Astra DB**:      Used DataStax Astra DB to store the simulated engagement data in a structured database format.  3. **Building a Workflow in Langflow**:      Developed an automated workflow that takes a post type as input, queries the database for engagement metrics, and passes the results to GPT for analysis.  4. **Generating Insights Using GPT**:      GPT generates actionable insights from the engagement metrics, such as identifying the best-performing post types and suggesting reasons for their success.  5. **Documenting and Demonstrating the Process**:      Recorded a video explaining the solution, showcasing the workflow, and demonstrating the system in action.  ## Features  - **Mock Engagement Dataset**:     A CSV file containing post types, engagement metrics, and timestamps.  - **Database Operations**:     Setup and managed using DataStax Astra DB for storing and querying the engagement data.  - **Automated Workflow**:     Langflow workflow for querying metrics and processing insights.  - **Insights Generation**:     GPT-powered analysis to provide meaningful insights into social media post performance.  ## Files and Directories  - `data/`: Contains the mock dataset (CSV/JSON format). - `scripts/`: Python scripts for uploading data to Astra DB and querying engagement metrics. - `workflows/`: Langflow workflow export file. - `README.md`: Project setup and usage instructions. - `demo/`: Link to the demo video showcasing the project.  ## How It Works  1. Input a post type (e.g., reels, carousels) through Langflow.   2. The workflow queries the database and calculates average engagement metrics.   3. GPT analyzes the metrics and generates insights (e.g., "Reels have 2x more comments compared to other post types.").    ## Getting Started  ### Prerequisites - Python 3.8+ - DataStax Astra DB account - Langflow installed - GPT API key  ### Setup Instructions 1. Clone the repository.   2. Set up the Astra DB database and import the dataset using the provided scripts.   3. Load the Langflow workflow and test the system.   4. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` for a detailed guide.  ## Demo Video  ðŸ“ºhttps://youtu.be/Sgr22ck-PY4  ## Contributing  Contributions are welcome!
